I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.


./final_4_relerr_gmres.tex:1: LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

You're in trouble here.  Try typing  <return>  to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.

There should be exactly one # between &'s, when an
\halign or \valign is being set up. In this case you had
none, so I've put one in; maybe that will work.

./final_4_relerr_gmres.tex:2: Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.2 \end{array}
               
I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
